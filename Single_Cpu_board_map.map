WARNING:Pack:2574 - The F7 multiplexer symbol
   "Single_Cpu_real/Stage_5/Mmux_write_data89" and its I1 input driver
   "Single_Cpu_real/Stage_5/Mmux_write_data84" were implemented suboptimally in
   the same slice component. The function generator could not be placed directly
   driving the F7 multiplexer. The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.
