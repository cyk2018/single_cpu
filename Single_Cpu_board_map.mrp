Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       268 out of  13,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        4,872
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         4,161 out of   4,872   85%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  41 out of   4,872    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         670 out of   4,872   13%
    Number of unique control sets:              12
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              32 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
